You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/howami181/timer-kotlin/releases). 

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: Easily create countdown timers with customizable intervals.
- **Stopwatch**: Implement a stopwatch that tracks elapsed time accurately.
- **Coroutines Flow**: Leverage Kotlin Coroutines Flow for asynchronous programming, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Multiplatform Support**: Designed to work across different platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform.
- **Simple API**: The library offers an easy-to-use API that integrates seamlessly into your existing projects.

## Installation

To add the Kotlin Timer Library to your project, follow these steps:

### Gradle Dependency

## Usage

### Countdown Timer

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Countdown Timer feature:

```kotlin
import com.example.timer.CountdownTimer

fun startCountdown() {
    val timer = CountdownTimer(60000) // 1 minute countdown
    timer.start { remainingTime ->
        println("Time remaining: $remainingTime ms")
    }
}
```

### Stopwatch

Using the Stopwatch is just as straightforward:

```kotlin
import com.example.timer.Stopwatch

fun startStopwatch() {
    val stopwatch = Stopwatch()
    stopwatch.start()

    // Do something

    stopwatch.stop()
    println("Elapsed time: ${stopwatch.elapsedTime} ms")
}
```
